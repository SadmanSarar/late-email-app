The Late Email app
------------------

#### Motivation
In my current office, the importance of punctuality is greatly valued. To enforce punctuality
on the employees, the daily entry time of the employee is recorded and later add to monthly evaluation. If someone is unable to enter 
into the office within 20 minutes after office start time, the employee is considered late. The protocol
is to send a mail to the supervisor, keeping HR in CC, mentioning reasons of late and asking for acknowledgement.

As I live in one of the densely populated city in the world (7th according to [this](http://worldpopulationreview.com/world-cities/)) with terrible traffic condition,
I had to write apology mails for being late very often. 

So I decided write an app that will help me compose late email.
